### [Announcing Swift Homomorphic Encryption](https://www.swift.org/blog/announcing-swift-homomorphic-encryption/)

Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying unencrypted data to the operating process. It provides a means for clients to send encrypted data to a server, which operates on that encrypted data and returns a result that the client can decrypt. During the execution of the request, the server itself never decrypts the original data or even has access to the decryption key. Such an approach presents new opportunities for cloud services to operate while protecting the privacy and security of a user's data, which is obviously highly attractive for many scenarios.

### [Trigger property observers from initializers in Swift](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/TriggerPropertyObserversFromInitializersInSwift/)

In Swift, property observers such as willSet and didSet are not called when a property is set in an initializer. This is by design, as the initializer's purpose is to set up the initial state of an object, and during this phase, the object is not yet fully initialized. However, if we need to perform some actions similar to what we'd do in property observers during initialization, there are some workarounds as [Natalia Panferova](https://x.com/natpanferova) discovers

### [Navigation patterns in SwiftUI](https://azamsharp.com/2024/07/29/navigation-patterns-in-swiftui.html)

Navigation has often been a challenge in SwiftUI applications. Initially, SwiftUI introduced `NavigationView`, which was later replaced by `NavigationStack` in iOS 16.

`NavigationStack` enhanced navigation by enabling dynamic and programmatic routing, and it also offered ways to centralize routes for the entire application. In this article, Mohammad Azam explores some common navigation patterns that can be employed when building SwiftUI applications.

## Xcode tips

### [Paste in Xcode's navigator area to create a file](https://x.com/v_pradeilles/status/1818610834232508534)

[Vincent Pradeilles](https://x.com/v_pradeilles) shared a cool new feature available on Xcode 16. You can now paste content into the Project Navigator, and Xcode will automatically create a new file with the approriate name. Neat!
