## Swift

### [Mastering Observation framework in Swift](http://swiftwithmajid.com/2023/10/03/mastering-observable-framework-in-swift)

Apple introduced the new Observation framework powered by the macro feature of the Swift language. The new Observation framework, in combination with the Swift Concurrency features, allows us to replace the Combine framework that looks deprecated by Apple. This week, we will learn how to use the Observation framework to handle data flow in our apps.

### [Migrating from the Observable Object protocol to the Observable macro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro)

Here's Apple with a dedicated documentation page and a sample app to help us transition from using `ObservableObject` towards adopting the `@Observable` macro.

## Utils

### [swift-perception](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-perception)

The Perception library provides tools that mimic `@Observable` and `withObservationTracking` in Swift 5.9, but they are backported to work all the way back to iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13 and watchOS 6. This means you can start taking advantage of Swift 5.9's observation tools today, even if you can't drop support for older Apple platforms.
