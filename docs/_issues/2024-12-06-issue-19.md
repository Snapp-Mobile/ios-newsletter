Hi again, folks!

We hope you struck some cool Cyber Monday deals. Starting with this issue of the newsletter, we're going to link the author profiles on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/) (where possible). We know you understand the reason.

You may as well find a directory with the profiles of some of our colleagues and friends on BlueSky [at this link](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/did:plc:njenuzazhpmwebebpke7y4ci/3lbeo3yxb7r2n).

Enjoy this week's mixture!

## Swift

### [Lazy vars in @Observable classes in Swift](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/LazyVarsInObservableClasses/)

`@Observable` is the new hype, but adopting it comes with some interesting challenges. If you ever had to convert a class that has a lazy property, you may want to take a look at [Natalia Panferova](https://bsky.app/profile/natpanferova.bsky.social)'s discovery.

### [MainActor usage in Swift explained to dispatch to the main thread](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/mainactor-dispatch-main-thread/)

We've been sharing articles related to the new `Concurrency` framework for quite some time. This one has a lot of information on the usage of `@MainActor` and actors in general, but it also contains a gotcha related to using methods annotated with `@MainActor` from a _synchronous nonisolated context_ - a thing that may produce unwanted results for people who don't have the Swift 6 compiler mode enabled.

## UI/UX

### [On Apple's Guidance for StateObject Initialization](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/dependency-injection-with-state-object-swiftui/)

SwiftUI relies on a few specialized property wrappers for managing the state in its views. Among the newer additions is a thing called `@StateObject`. This article takes a detailed look at how we can consider it a private state within the view scope and why this property wrapper is so useful.

### [Scenes types in a SwiftUI Mac app](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/ScenesTypesInASwiftUIMacApp/)

Making applications for macOS is both familiar and different for iOS developers. Understanding the various supported scene types is key to creating a product that fits in. This article looks into the different types of scenes and uncovers their distinct behaviors and capabilities.

### [Prevent screenshot capture of sensitive SwiftUI views](https://www.createwithswift.com/prevent-screenshot-capture-of-sensitive-swiftui-views/)

Security has many forms and taking it into account always pays off. This article looks into implementing a feature that prevents sensitive content from being captured in screenshots and screen recordings with SwiftUI - a feature many apps can benefit from.

### [Creating view transitions in SwiftUI](https://www.createwithswift.com/creating-view-transitions-in-swiftui/)

When done right, animations can enhance the user experience of an app. One of the most common places to apply animation is when things appear/disappear/change on-screen. SwiftUI has a great set of tools that are accessible through the `transition` view modifier for this, and this article walks you through how to use them.

## Repository

### [SwiftUI-experiments](https://github.com/mikelikesdesign/SwiftUI-experiments)

We have recently stumbled upon this useful repository where [Michael Lee](https://github.com/mikelikesdesign) has shared some quite interesting UI/UX explorations. It's a lot to digest and learn from, so we hope you are as excited about it as we are.

## Talk

### [Xogot: Godot on iPad Preview](https://blog.la-terminal.net/xogot-godot-on-ipad-preview/)

[Miguel De Icaza](https://bsky.app/profile/migueldeicaza.bsky.social) announced that you can now get the first beta of Xogot on TestFlight. Xogot is a project to bring Godot on iPad, and the talk is a fascinating story of bringing it to life. Along with it, there's a repo with [Swift bindings for Godot](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot), so you may give it a try if it scratches an itch.
