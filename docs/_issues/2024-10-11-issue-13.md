Hey hey,

With a couple of important announcements from Apple, and a few articles on server-side Swift, we ran out of space for UI/UX entries again.

We managed to squeeze one for you, though. And, in case you haven't yet, we highly recommend looking at the updated `TabView` appearance and behavior for iPadOS 18 â€” there was a [dedicated WWDC session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10147) on it this year.

Enjoy this week's mixture!

## News

### [Apple Push Notification service server certificate update](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09za8wzy)

Apple announced that the Certification Authority (CA) for Apple Push Notification service (APNs) is changing. The certificates in sandbox will be updated on JanuaryÂ 20,Â 2025, and in production on FebruaryÂ 24,Â 2025. All developers using APNs will need to update their applicationâ€™s Trust Store to include the new server certificate. You can find more info and link to the updated certificate in the article.

### [New requirements for app updates in the European union](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yfacfeal)

Apple published new requirements for app updates in the EU that have been in place since last Friday. To submit app updates, Account Holders or Admins in the Apple Developer Program need to enter trader status in App Store Connect. All apps without a trader status will be removed from the App Store in the EU starting February 17, 2025.

## Swift

### [Global actors in Swift](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2024/03/12/global-actors-in-swift/)

Actors are important building blocks in Swift 6. Understanding them is key to applying thread-safety with the new Concurrency model. This article focuses on the `GlobalActor` protocol and the `@globalActor` annotation and explores their application.

## Xcode

### [AnyView is everywhere in Xcode 16](https://augmentedcode.io/2024/10/21/anyview-is-everywhere-in-xcode-16/)

Apple has claimed that the new execution engine for Previews in Xcode 16 is up to 30% faster, but it seems this comes at the cost of wrapping your views in `AnyView` for debug builds. Luckily for us, there's a way to opt out of this behavior as the article suggests.

## Server-side Swift

### [Build a Web Service with Vapor](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/vapor-web-server/)

[Vapor](https://vapor.codes) has been around for quite some time, has a great community, and has been following the Swift language evolution quite closely. In fact, it's among the first projects that proved that Swift can be used for a lot more than writing iOS applications. It's definitely worth a look if you are seeking a (hobby) project. Here's an article on getting the basics up and running.

### [Vapor and Swift Testing: Running tests in parallel](https://www.avanderlee.com/general/vapor-and-swift-testing-running-tests-in-parallel/)

[Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl) with another useful article, full of tips on how to set up your Vapor codebase for testing. Even more, he takes a look at speeding up your tests by running them in parallel leveraging the new `SwiftTesting` framework. (Neat!)

### [Deploying to AWS with Fargate, Vapor, and MongoDB Atlas](https://www.swift.org/documentation/server/guides/deploying/aws-copilot-fargate-vapor-mongo.html)

In case you get involved a bit deeper with server-side, and you need an idea on hosting your project - here's an article that goes through a potential solution. Even if you choose not to use AWS (or even MongoDB Atlas), the information on how to set up your project in a Docker container is still valuable.

## UI/UX

### [How to embed views in a tab bar using TabView](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-embed-views-in-a-tab-bar-using-tabview)

Finally some UI/UX material â€” as we promised last week ðŸ˜Š. A new enhancement to SwiftUI (starting from iOS 18) is the introduction of a `Tab` and `TabSection` views that we can use to describe the `TabView` content semantically. These are related to the new behavior for the `TabViews` on the iPad, and thanks to [Paul Hudson](https://mastodon.social/@twostraws) we now have some examples on how to deal with them.
