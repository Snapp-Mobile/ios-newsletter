Hi folks,

as this is the last issue of the newsletter for the year, we wish you happy holidays.

Let us all take some good rest and prepare to make the next year better :)

Enjoy the selection!

## Swift

### [COW2LLVM: The isKnownUniquelyReferenced Deep-Dive](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/cow2llvm-the-isknownuniquelyreferenced)

Dive deep into one of the optimizations in the Swift Language - the copy-on-write. Discover how it really works by looking into the source code of the Swift compiler.

### [What is a Crash?](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/what-is-a-crash)

Promoted as "an exceptional deep dive", who are we to argue? This is another valuable article from [Jacob Bartlett](https://substack.com/@jacobbartlett) focused on error handling in Swift.

### [Xcode Kotlin - Xcode support for Kotlin browsing and debugging](https://touchlab.co/xcodekotlin)

Now, this is a thing that some developers may find very useful. If you have to adopt some KMP in your project it is, no doubt, helpful to have some access to the Kotlin side of things - even if it's for overcoming the black box syndrome. The debugging features are quite a bonus.

## UI/UX

### [Xcode Library customization with SPM plugin](https://www.artemnovichkov.com/blog/xcode-library-customization-with-spm-plugin)

If you ship a package of custom components, exposing them to Xcode's library is something that will pay off in the long term, for sure. The `LibraryContentProvider` protocol has been around since iOS 14, so doing this now will affect most of your clients, here's how.

### [Blooming fireworks with Metal and SwiftUI](https://uvolchyk.medium.com/blooming-fireworks-with-metal-and-swiftui-6550cef997e2)

It's almost new year, let's have some fireworks!

### [Auto-filling one-time verification codes in SwiftUI](https://bsky.app/profile/iosdevalb.bsky.social/post/3ldnpt7spek2d)

Social media can be a great source of targeted, bite-sized pieces of information for us to absorb. This BlueSky post is a great example.

## Repositories

### [SelectiveEquatable](https://swiftpackageindex.com/DandyLyons/SelectiveEquatable)

This micro framework helps you deal with conforming to `Equatable` by checking only certain properties of your type. A thing that may be useful for your projects.

### [iOS-Performance-Optimization](https://github.com/hoangatuan/iOS-Performance-Optimization)

This repository contains a collection of links to performance-related articles and tools, grouped into focused collections for sorting out app size issues, slow build time, app launch time, app hangs and more. Bookmark-worthy material!
