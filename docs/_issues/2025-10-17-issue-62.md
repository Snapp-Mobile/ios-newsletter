Hi folks,

Autumn may have arrived on the calendar weeks ago, but now it’s finally in the air — perfect for a warm drink, family moments, and a fresh look at what’s new in iOS development. The tech world isn't slowing down either - [iOS 26.1 Beta 3](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=ios-26.1-beta-3) dropped on October 13th and [TestFlight 4.0](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/release-notes/) got a refreshed Liquid Glass UI.

In this issue, we're exploring background task strategies, diving into SwiftUI image caching techniques, and discovering how Swift's new subprocess package could revolutionize CLI automation.
