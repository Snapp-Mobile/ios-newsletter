Hi folks!

Weeks are getting busy as expected. Apple seeded beta 2 of 26.3 on January 12, bringing new builds for you to test. And don't overlook the [App Store Connect Upcoming Requirements](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/) notice — the updated age rating system takes effect January 31, 2026, so make sure you've reviewed the changes and submitted your responses to avoid any delays.

This week's articles explore EventKit reminders, Swift string interpolation mastery, LLM tokenization fundamentals, MusicKit implementation challenges, compiler contribution insights, AI's impact on team dynamics, Vision framework text detection, and creative Metal toolchain workarounds. Let's dive in!
