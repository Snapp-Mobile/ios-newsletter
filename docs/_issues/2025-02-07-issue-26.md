Hi folks,

The biggest piece of news this week in the Swift community is the open-sourcing of Xcode's build system, `xcodebuild`, which hs now been renamed `swift-build`. This has a potential to turn coding for non-Apple platforms a much more predictable experience.

What do you think?

## Swift

### [The Next Chapter in Swift Build Technologies](https://www.swift.org/blog/the-next-chapter-in-swift-build-technologies/)

As we stated in the intro, open-sourcing the Xcode build system is a big step forward for the Swift community. An unexpected one, too. Read more about the thought process and the aims behind it.

### [Swift Everywhere: Bringing Swift Packages to Android](https://skip.tools/blog/android-native-swift-packages/)

We've covered Skip in the past (see [issue #5](/issues/2024-08-30-issue-5)), and it seems like the team behind it is not having a rest. This article covers how Swift Packages can be used on Android, if that's your cup of tea.

### [Swift Everywhere: Using Interoperability to Build on Windows](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-everywhere-windows-interop/)

If you have an itch to scratch - say, by coding in Swift on Windows - here's an overview of what's possible (hello there, C/C++ interop). This article may also serve as a starting point for your explorations.

### [Adwaita for Swift](https://adwaita-swift.aparoksha.dev/documentation/adwaita/)

Lastly, though not least in importance, there's also a library that allows you to use `Adwaita` (the library behind GNOME) in Swift. This one is something we've been monitoring for some time - not only because we love Swift and Linux, but because its ergonomics are very much `SwiftUI`-like. Who said coding apps for Linux shouldn't be fun?

## Maps

### [Core Location Modern API Tips](https://twocentstudios.com/2024/12/02/core-location-modern-api-tips/)

Many of us have built at least one location-aware app. This article covers some of the lessons learned by using the `CoreLocation` APIs, what the tradeoffs between the old and the modern APIs are, and is a great resource to keep around for reference.

### [Drawing maps with Swift Charts](https://www.artemnovichkov.com/blog/drawing-maps-with-swift-charts)

This caught us off-guard. We were aware of the flexibility that `SwiftCharts` offers, but we never expected it to be capable of drawing free forms. This is a relatively new feature, supported in iOS 18, but that does not diminish how useful it is. Here's a great article on how to leverage this creatively, thanks to [Artem Novichkov](https://www.artemnovichkov.com/).

## UI/UX

### [Debugging SwiftUI Layouts: Tips, Tricks, and Techniques](https://medium.com/@wesleymatlock/debugging-swiftui-layouts-tips-tricks-and-techniques-917f73b36838)

We wrote about debugging `SwiftUI` [a couple of weeks ago](/issues/2025-01-24-issue-24). This link can be treated as a follow-up as it explores some techniques that go beyond the `_printChanges()` method.

### [Readability: The Optimal Line Length](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability)

Finally, this may not be much of a technical resource, but it's a great overview on text composition for readability. We found these sorts of articles to be sources of information that we leverage a lot when building our apps.
