Hi folks!

The year is coming to an end and annual reviews are happening. We spotted a fascinating [article](https://techtrenches.substack.com/p/why-annual-reviews-dont-have-to-be) by [Denis Stetskov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denjkestetskov/) about rethinking annual reviews — worth checking out if you're planning your strategy for next year.

This week, [new requirements for Social Media Apps in Australia](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y1bckxf8) start to be mandatory, bringing the [Declared Age Range API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/) into focus. It's likely this will become worldwide eventually, so now's the perfect time to get experience with this API.

**Apple releases:** [26.2 RC's 2 were released](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/), continuing the steady pace of platform evolution.

This week we've got SwiftUI effects, watchOS pitfalls, co-design methodology, Swift 6 settings, visionOS automation, and plenty of AI insights — something for everyone. Enjoy the reading!
