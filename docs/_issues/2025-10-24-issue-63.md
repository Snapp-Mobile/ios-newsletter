Hi folks!

This week brings a dose of reality about where we stand with AI development. [Andrej Karpathy's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUZvyajciY&t=6253s) reminds us we're "summoning ghosts, not building animals" — a valuable perspective as the hype cycle continues. Meanwhile, [concerns about software quality collapse](https://techtrenches.substack.com/p/the-great-software-quality-collapse) across the industry make our focus on craftsmanship even more critical.

On the technical front, iOS 26.1 Beta 4 introduces the Liquid Glass transparency toggle and lock screen camera controls, while the Swift @Animatable macro gets broader platform support.

This issue explores architectural patterns (MVVM with SwiftData, singleton thread-safety), platform-specific features (visionOS 3D models, immersive web experiences), and developer practices that separate fast engineers from great ones. We also dive into server-side Swift with Valkey, debugging with dSYMs, and AI as a development partner.

Stay sharp, aim for excellence, and let's build things that matter.

## Development

### [The Fast Engineer Trap](https://digitalbunker.dev/the-fast-engineer-trap/)

Chasing speed in engineering breeds bad habits — but why does slowing down actually build trust, depth, and lasting growth? [Aryaman Sharda](https://www.digitalbunker.dev) reflects on a career lesson about moving fast versus moving smart.

### [With AI, I can just build things!](https://antran.app/2025/you_can_just_do_things/)

How is AI transforming your ability to code beyond your specialization? [An Tran](https://antran.app) demonstrates using AI as a multilingual engineering partner.

### [Is SwiftData incompatible with MVVM?](https://matteomanferdini.com/swiftdata-mvvm/)

Thinking MVVM and SwiftData don't mix? [Matteo Manferdini](https://github.com/matteom) reveals how proper understanding of SwiftUI's core principles makes them perfectly compatible.

## Concurrency

### [Singletons with Swift Concurrency](https://www.massicotte.org/singletons)

Are your singletons causing concurrency headaches in Swift 6? [Matt Massicotte](https://bsky.app/profile/massicotte.org) breaks down the thread-safety challenges and shows practical patterns for making them work.

## visionOS

### [Exploring the Different Ways to Load 3D Models in visionOS](https://swiftorbit.io/load-3d-models-realitykit-visionos/)

Ready to bring spatial experiences to life? [Anas Belkhadir](https://swiftorbit.io) explores different ways to load and integrate 3D models using RealityKit.

### [Adding Immersive Environments to a Web Page](https://stepinto.vision/articles/adding-immersive-environment-to-a-web-page/)

Want to blow your users' minds with immersive web experiences? [Joseph Simpson](https://bsky.app/profile/vrhermit.com) walks through creating website environments using USDZ files in visionOS 26.

## Framework

### [The Valkey Swift Package: from Local to Serverless](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/valkey-package)

Need a lightning-fast in-memory store for your server-side Swift app? [Natan Rolnik](https://bsky.app/profile/natanrolnik.bsky.social) shows how to connect to `Valkey` from local Docker containers to serverless Lambda functions.

## Tools

### [Adding dSYMs from a closed-source Swift SDK to an app](https://danielsaidi.com/blog/2025/10/19/adding-dsyms-from-a-closed-source-sdk-to-your-app)

Getting cryptic stack traces from closed-source SDKs? [Daniel Saidi](https://danielsaidi.com) explains how to add `dSYMs` to transform those useless crash reports into readable ones.
