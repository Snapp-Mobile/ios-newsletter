Hi folks!

This week is buzzing with AI energy. Packages like [AnyLanguageModel](https://github.com/mattt/AnyLanguageModel) make it easy to build AI-powered iOS apps without locking into one company's API. And then there's the [OpenAI + Shortcuts team deal](https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/23/openai-just-bought-the-team-behind-apple-shortcuts/) ‚Äî because AI automation is here.

But here's what's real: [Henning Pauly recently demonstrated](https://youtu.be/dhx2XL9XcjU?si=oCKnDjG7mFAJK8Z3) that AI can now create music in minutes that took artists days to make. Same quality. Way faster. The creative game is shifting. You can jump in, use these tools to move faster and iterate more, or keep doing things the old way. Either way, it's your call.

Meanwhile, **exciting news for the cross-platform dev community**: Apple just greenlit the [Swift SDK for Android](https://www.swift.org/blog/nightly-swift-sdk-for-android/) ‚Äî and the KMM fans are celebrating, aren't they üòÅ. It's a big moment for folks who've been betting on shared code across iOS and Android.

Apple's ecosystem continues evolving too, with [streamlined App Store submission tools](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=gf6mgrs6) and refined developer workflows. The community keeps pushing forward with practical security patterns, concurrency mastery, and thoughtful explorations of code quality.

Whether you're building responsive UIs, writing safer code, improving performance, or hardening your security posture, this issue covers the tools and techniques shaping modern iOS development.

## SwiftUI

### [ScrollView snapping in SwiftUI](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/ScrollViewSnappingInSwiftUI)

Want your scrolling to snap perfectly to pages or specific views? [Natalia Panferova](https://bsky.app/profile/natpanferova.bsky.social) explores SwiftUI's `scrollTargetBehavior` and `scrollTargetLayout` APIs for precise control over scroll snapping behavior.
