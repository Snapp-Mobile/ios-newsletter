Hi folks,

So. Much. AI. It feels like it's everywhere at the moment, doesn't it? We're leaning right into the hype this week with a look at the latest in Apple's AI world. Don't worry, we've also sprinkled in some excellent articles on Swift, Core Data, and keeping your codebase healthy. Grab a coffee, and let's dive in.

Enjoy the selection!

## Swift

### [Opaque Types in Swift: Hiding Details, Not Power](https://swiftshorts.com/opaque-types-in-swift-hiding-details-not-power/)

This article by [Saifullah Sajid](https://github.com/saifullahsajid) provides a concise explanation of opaque types in Swift, using the `some` keyword. It clarifies how they allow functions to return a concrete type that conforms to a protocol, without revealing the specific underlying type. This is particularly useful for maintaining abstraction and flexibility in your code.

### [Evolving a Codebase](https://stackedbytes.dev/posts/2025/evolving-a-codebase/)

A thoughtful piece from [Dr. Beat Rupp](https://rupp.digital/) on practical strategies for improving and evolving a codebase. It details various techniques, from low-risk compiler-assisted cleanups like reducing public interfaces and cleaning imports, to higher-risk refactorings such as dependency injection and abstracting third-party libraries, emphasizing the importance of unit tests for safe evolution.

## Data

### [How Core Data Saves Data in SQLite](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/tables_and_fields_of_coredata/)

This in-depth article from [Fatbobman's Blog](https://fatbobman.com) demystifies the inner workings of Core Data's SQLite persistence layer. It explains the structure of the tables and fields that Core Data automatically generates, such as `Z_PK`, `Z_ENT`, and `Z_OPT`, and how they relate to `NSManagedObjectID`.

## AI/ML

### [Getting started with Apple Foundation Models](https://www.artemnovichkov.com/blog/getting-started-with-apple-foundation-models)

A practical guide by [Artem Novichkov](https://github.com/artemnovichkov) to getting started with Apple's new Foundation Models framework. It walks through the process of using on-device large language models for various tasks, with a focus on privacy and performance.

### [MLX-Outil](https://github.com/rudrankriyam/MLX-Outil)

This project by [Rudrank Riyam](https://bsky.app/profile/rudrankriyam.bsky.social) allows you to use the Qwen 3 1.7B model with the help of MLX Swift. It's a Swift package that provides a set of system integration tools, allowing the language model to perform various actions, including fetching weather, accessing workout data, searching the web, and managing calendar events.

### [FoundationChat](https://github.com/Dimillian/FoundationChat/tree/main)

An open-source chat application by [Thomas Dimillian](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian) built with SwiftUI and the Foundation Models framework. It serves as a great example of how to build a modern, AI-powered chat experience on Apple platforms.

## Tools

### [Sparkle: Distribution apps in- and out of the Mac App Store](https://www.avanderlee.com/xcode/sparkle-distribution-apps-in-and-out-of-the-mac-app-store/)

This article by [Antoine van der Lee](https://bsky.app/profile/avanderlee.com) details the process of using the Sparkle framework to distribute macOS applications both through the Mac App Store and independently. It covers the challenges of maintaining a single codebase for both distribution channels.

### [Olleh](https://github.com/loopwork/olleh)

Olleh (hello reversed) by [Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt) is a command-line interface (CLI) and HTTP server that is compatible with the Ollama ecosystem, allowing developers to interact with Apple's new Foundation Models. It acts as a bridge, making Apple's native AI models accessible through familiar Ollama-style commands and API endpoints.
