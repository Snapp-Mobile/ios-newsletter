Hi folks!

2026 is officially underway — a good moment to reflect on goals for the year ahead. Learning is at the heart of growth, whether you're exploring new technologies or deepening expertise in areas you already know. AI will play a significant role in our industry, and curiosity will be our greatest asset. Let's lead and shape what comes next.

Apple's [Hello Developer: January 2026](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zni5qkkl) is packed this month — SwiftUI foundational sessions, Liquid Glass design activities, Foundation Models tutorials, and coding intelligence experiments. Don't miss [Explore the foundations of SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/events/view/555Z39SH4B/dashboard?cid=ADC-DM-c00368-M00812) if you haven't registered yet.

In this issue, we're covering on-device AI prompting, SwiftUI state quirks, SF Symbol animations, and the art of app icon design. Stay curious, and enjoy this week's picks!
