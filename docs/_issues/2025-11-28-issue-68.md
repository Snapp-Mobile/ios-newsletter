Hi folks!

Happy Friday! Winter is approaching, and with it comes a great opportunity to catch up on the latest iOS and Swift developments. Apple continues to deliver with new beta releases and tooling improvements — iOS 26.2 beta 3 arrived last week with "Edge Light" video-call lighting for macOS and refined UX across Reminders, News, and Podcasts apps. That makes it important to keep our apps updated as the platform evolves!

This week we've pulled together articles covering the full spectrum of iOS development. From platform modernization (iOS 26.2 betas) and developer tooling (package automation) to UI patterns (SwiftUI layouts and macOS interactions), state management (`@Observable`, `@MainActor`), security (DeviceCheck), design (data visualization), and strategic insights on project lifecycle decisions — there's something for every engineer.

We're grateful for your continued readership. Enjoy the issue!
