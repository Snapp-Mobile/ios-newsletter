Hi folks!

Fortunately our newsletter isn't dependent on delivery providers, so no delays for our subscribers here. Hope Black Friday's purchases arrived safely — or even better, you embraced the JOMO and are living your best life.

Apple went on a release spree this week — 26.2 RC's are out for [all platforms](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/#:~:text=Xcode%2026), all packed with goodies for developers. Xcode 26.2 tagged along, and TestFlight now plays nice with Managed Apple Accounts for tighter [beta testing](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-internal-testers) security.

Right before we light up your sky with this week's articles — check out (if you haven't yet) your [Apple Replay](https://replay.music.apple.com/) to see what you *really* listened to this year. Now, put your glasses on:
