Hi folks,

Welcome to issue #35 of our iOS newsletter!

Whew, what a week it's been! Markets going wild and politics doing its thing while we've all been busy coding away. But hey, that's the world we live in!

This week, we're diving into Swift concurrency improvements, SwiftUI patterns, architecture best practices, and deployment options. We've curated articles that will help you navigate the complexities of modern iOS development while the world outside keeps spinning at its own unpredictable pace.

Let's get started!

## Swift

### [Understanding Atomicity in Programming](https://www.donnywals.com/what-does-atomic-mean-in-programming/)
[Donny Wals](https://bsky.app/profile/donnywals.bsky.social) explores atomicity in programming. The article details how atomic operations ensure data consistency in concurrent environments where multiple threads access shared data. 

### [Creating Sendable Wrappers for Non-Sendable Types](https://ashidiqi.com/blog/create-sendable-wrapper-for-non-sendable-types-in-swift-concurrency/)
[Ash Furrow](https://ashidiqi.com) shows how to create Sendable wrappers for non-Sendable types in Swift concurrency. The article offers practical solutions for making non-thread-safe types work reliably in concurrent environments.

## SwiftUI

### [Mastering SwiftUI Alerts](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/swiftui-alert-presenting/)
[Antoine van der Lee](https://github.com/AvdLee) shares a practical guide to handling alerts in SwiftUI. Learn how to structure alert logic cleanly, manage actions, and avoid common pitfalls in complex scenarios.

### [Understanding SwiftUI Namespace](https://kyleye.top/posts/swiftui-namespace/)
[Kyle Ye](https://github.com/Kyle-Ye) dives into how namespaces power advanced animations in SwiftUI. By using `matchedGeometryEffect`, article shows how to create seamless transitions between views that feel smooth and connected, helping users stay oriented during navigation. It’s a great read for anyone looking to level up their animation game.

### [Why Avoid SwiftUI Group](https://chris.eidhof.nl/post/why-i-avoid-group/)
[Chris Eidhof](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl) shares why he often avoids using Group in SwiftUI. A worthwhile read to understand when and why it’s better to avoid using it.

## Data

### [SwiftData Architecture Patterns and Best Practices](https://azamsharp.com/2025/03/28/swiftdata-architecture-patterns-and-practices.html)
[Mohammad Azam](https://azamsharp.com) explores how to structure your SwiftData layer for scalability and maintainability. He covers architecture patterns like repository and dependency injection, and includes strategies for unit testing and modularization. A solid resource for teams adopting SwiftData in production.

### [SwiftUI Environment: Concepts and Practice](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/swiftui-environment-concepts-and-practice/)
[Fatbobman](https://bsky.app/profile/fatbobman.bsky.social) provides a comprehensive look at the SwiftUI environment system. The article explains environment values, objects, and modifiers with hands-on examples, while also addressing advanced use cases and common issues. It’s packed with insights to help manage shared state more effectively.

## Deployment

### [Deploying Swift Applications with Fly and Railway](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/deploy-fly-railway)
The Swift Toolkit team shares a step-by-step tutorial for deploying server-side Swift apps using Fly.io and Railway. It covers everything from initial setup and configuration to CI integration and monitoring. Perfect for developers building full-stack Swift applications or looking to streamline their deployment process.
