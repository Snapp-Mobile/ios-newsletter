Hi folks,

Welcome to issue #35 of our iOS newsletter! Last week felt as a year or so. 

This week, we're diving into Swift concurrency improvements, SwiftUI patterns, architecture best practices, and deployment options. Let's get started!

Happy coding!

## Swift

### [Understanding Atomicity in Programming](https://www.donnywals.com/what-does-atomic-mean-in-programming/)
[Donny Wals](https://bsky.app/profile/donnywals.bsky.social) explains the concept of atomicity in programming, a fundamental principle that ensures operations either complete fully or not at all. He clarifies how atomic operations help maintain data consistency, especially in concurrent environments where multiple threads might access the same data simultaneously. This is essential knowledge for Swift developers working with shared resources.

### [Creating Sendable Wrappers for Non-Sendable Types](https://ashidiqi.com/blog/create-sendable-wrapper-for-non-sendable-types-in-swift-concurrency/)
[Ash Furrow](https://ashidiqi.com) provides a detailed guide on how to create Sendable wrappers for non-Sendable types in Swift concurrency. This technique is particularly valuable when working with older APIs or third-party libraries that haven't been updated for Swift's actor isolation system. The article includes practical examples of wrapping non-thread-safe types to make them work safely in concurrent contexts.

## SwiftUI

### [Mastering SwiftUI Alerts](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/swiftui-alert-presenting/)
[Antoine van der Lee](https://github.com/AvdLee) delivers a comprehensive guide on presenting alerts in SwiftUI. The article covers various approaches for showing alerts, handling alert actions, and structuring your alert logic. He demonstrates best practices for maintaining clean code while implementing complex alert scenarios and avoiding common pitfalls.

### [Understanding SwiftUI Namespace](https://kyleye.top/posts/swiftui-namespace/)
[Kyle Ye](https://github.com/Kyle-Ye) breaks down the concept of namespace in SwiftUI and how it enables more advanced animations and transitions between views. This deep dive explains how to use the matchedGeometryEffect modifier to create smooth, connected animations that maintain context for users as they navigate through your app's interface.

### [Why Avoid SwiftUI Group](https://chris.eidhof.nl/post/why-i-avoid-group/)
[Chris Eidhof](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl) explains why he tends to avoid using Group in SwiftUI. His thoughtful analysis covers potential performance issues, debugging challenges, and alternative approaches that can lead to more maintainable code. This is valuable insight from one of the most experienced voices in the Swift community.

## Architecture & Data

### [SwiftData Architecture Patterns and Best Practices](https://azamsharp.com/2025/03/28/swiftdata-architecture-patterns-and-practices.html)
[Mohammad Azam](https://azamsharp.com) shares architecture patterns and best practices for SwiftData, Apple's native persistence framework. The article explores various approaches to structuring your data layer, including repository patterns, dependency injection, and testing strategies. These guidelines help create maintainable SwiftData implementations that scale with your app's complexity.

### [SwiftUI Environment: Concepts and Practice](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/swiftui-environment-concepts-and-practice/)
[Fatbobman](https://bsky.app/profile/fatbobman.bsky.social) provides an in-depth exploration of SwiftUI's environment system. This comprehensive guide covers environment values, objects, and modifiers with practical examples of how to properly implement and leverage them in your apps. The article also addresses common pitfalls and advanced techniques for state management using environment.

## Deployment

### [Deploying Swift Applications with Fly and Railway](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/deploy-fly-railway)
The Swift Toolkit team has put together a practical guide on deploying server-side Swift applications using Fly.io and Railway. This tutorial walks through the deployment process step-by-step, covering configuration, continuous integration, and monitoring. It's a must-read for teams looking to streamline their backend Swift deployment workflows.
