Starting with iOS 17 Apple made it easy to display placeholder views when there's no content available. The link above leads to a graphical explanation on what the `ContentUnavailableView` looks like, and here's the [Apple documentation page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/contentunavailableview) with an example on how to use it for searching
