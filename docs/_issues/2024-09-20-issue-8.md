## Swift

### [Announcing Swift 6](https://www.swift.org/blog/announcing-swift-6/)

Swift 6 is finally here! This is a major new release that expands Swift to more platforms and domains. As the Swift language group states: 

> "Many people know of Swift as a language for app development, with a million apps on the App Store. But Swift is great for more than just apps. Swiftâ€™s safety, speed, and approachability make it a great choice for many other use cases including libraries, internet-scale services, and the most performance-critical and secure code.
>
>Swift 6 scales even further through new low-level programming features, an embedded Swift language subset, expanded Linux and Windows support, new cross-platform APIs including the new Swift Testing library, and more."

### [Deprecations in iOS/iPadOS 18](https://blog.stackademic.com/deprecations-in-ios-ipados-18-bb755bdfa6e4)

Swift 6 is just a part of what Apple brought to the market this year as it got anounced along with the new versions of iOS and iPadOS. However some pieces that have been around for a while have faced deprecations. This useful article captures the most significant ones and it's certainly bookmark-worthy.

## [Swift Noncopyable Type and Variable Ownerships](http://www.csl.cool/2023/06/05/ios-dev/swift/swift-noncopyable-types-and-variable-ownership/)

Noncopyable types are a relatively new Swift feature (introduced in Swift 5.9). Values of noncopyable type always have unique ownership, and can never be copied (at least, not using Swift's implicit copy mechanism). This article explains why and where this is helpful.

## UI

### [Animating number changes in SwiftUI](https://sarunw.com/posts/animating-number-changes-in-swiftui/)

We love these on-point articles from [Sarun W.](https://x.com/sarunw). Sometimes what a view composition needs is a neat animation to highlight a value change. Apple is using a nice numbers animation across their widgeting system and this article shows you how to apply that very same animation on any `SwiftUI` text view that contains numbers.

## Testing

### [Using Traits to annotate and customize test behavior](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift-testing/using-traits-to-annotate-and-customize-test-behavior/)

[Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl) has been busy writing another article, this time on how to use traits with the `SwiftTesting` framework that just got released along with Swift 6. Traits allow you to configure common behaviors, like runtime evaluated conditions, to skip certain tests.
