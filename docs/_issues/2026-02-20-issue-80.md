Hi folks!

The first betas for iOS 26.4 are here, and strangely enough, Xcode 26.3 stays in the RC state while Xcode 26.4 is available as a beta. Usually the RC phase does not last more than a week, but it seems like this is not the case this time, so we do hope that the final release of Xcode 26.3 is not far away.

This week we are looking at some accessibility topics, AI gaining speed, taking a look at some of the less-known corners of Swift, and we have a few entries on UI/UX.

We do hope you'll enjoy it.

# Articles

## AI / ML

### [Accepting Pandora's Box](https://alejandromp.com/personal/blog/accepting-pandora-s-box)

[Alejandro M. P.](https://alejandromp.com){: .author}

From skeptic to reluctant participant — here's one developer's journey through the moral maze of AI, with a few thoughts on why sitting out is no longer an option.

### [Swift Testing Agent Skill: Write high quality tests with AI](https://www.avanderlee.com/ai-development/swift-testing-agent-skill-write-high-quality-tests-with-ai/)

[Antoine van der Lee](https://bsky.app/profile/avanderlee.com){: .author}

As `SwiftTesting` is slowly becoming the de-facto standard framework for testing across Apple's ecosystem, integrating it into our development pipelines can be tricky. We assume that, like us, you rely on some agentic coding, so here's a useful resource that enables our agents to write tests with the framework.

## Swift6

### [Zettelkasten for Programmers: Documenting Confusing with `Swift.SendableMetatype`](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2026/01/zettelkasten-for-programmers-documenting-confusing-with-swift-sendablemetatype/)

[Christian Tietze](https://bsky.app/profile/ctietze.mastodon.social.ap.brid.gy){: .author}

Why does `@MainActor` isolation prevent `SendableMetatype` conformance? A puzzling concurrency constraint explored through documentation practice.

### [Fucking Approachable Swift Concurrency](https://fuckingapproachableswiftconcurrency.com/en/)

[Pedro Piñera Buendía](https://bsky.app/profile/pepicrft.bsky.social){: .author}

There's _almost_ a rule that we should not publish an issue of this newsletter without at least one article on Swift's concurrency model. It's simply because the topic is so big and nuanced that it finally got a dedicated _website_. It's a great read, and that makes it an absolutely mandatory bookmark.

## Accessibility

### [VoiceOver](https://wesleydegroot.nl/blog/voiceover)

[Wesley de Groot](https://bsky.app/profile/0xwdg.bsky.social){: .author}

Are you interested in making your SwiftUI app accessible to VoiceOver users? Discover essential accessibility modifiers, from labels and hints to proper element grouping.

## UI / UX

### [Highlighting code blocks in Markdown with `SwiftSyntax`](https://artemnovichkov.com/blog/highlighting-code-blocks-in-markdown-with-swiftsyntax)

[Artem Novichkov](https://github.com/artemnovichkov){: .author}

Want colorful code blocks in your SwiftUI markdown? Discover syntax highlighting with `SwiftSyntax`. It's probably the last thing we can think of doing with the framework, but it certainly _highlights_ how flexible it is.

### [Objectively Better, Observably Trickier](https://captainswiftui.substack.com/p/objectively-better-observably-trickier)

[Danny Bolella](https://bsky.app/profile/dbolella.bsky.social){: .author}

If you have tried it already you may have discovered that migrating from `@Published` to `@Observable` isn't a simple swap. (Re)discover the four traps that catch most developers off guard.

### [Isolate SwiftUI animations to specific attributes](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/IsolateSwiftUIAnimationsToSpecificAttributes/)

[Natalia Panferova](https://bsky.app/profile/natpanferova.bsky.social){: .author}

iOS 17.0 introduced a new `animation(_:body:)` view modifier, which takes an `Animation` and a `ViewBuilder` closure. The closure receives a proxy of the modified view, allowing us to specify attributes that should participate in the animation. This offers more granular control on the UI layer, so check this example to see how to adopt it in your apps.

... and with that, we're through. See you in the next one!
