Hi folks!

This week brings important releases from Skip, and [it is free now](https://skip.dev/blog/skip-is-free/). It has great potential to shift cross-platform attention to our side. Now it's probably a good time to try Skip and release your best app to more users.

In platform updates, Apple released 26.3 second betas, bringing bug fixes and stability improvements. The update [introduces a "Transfer to Android" tool](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-iphone-android-transfer-tool/) for wireless migration and [Notification Forwarding in the EU](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding/) to meet DMA requirements. iOS 26.3 also prepares end-to-end encrypted [RCS messaging for future carrier support](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/apple-encrypted-rcs-messaging-software-update/).

This week's issue covers everything from tvOS development challenges to SwiftUI architectural patterns, SwiftData migrations, and practical guides on charts and the Identifiable protocol. Let's dive in!

## SwiftUI

### [Emptiness in SwiftUI](https://captainswiftui.substack.com/p/emptiness-in-swiftui)

[Danny Bolella](https://bsky.app/profile/dbolella.bsky.social) distinguishes three types of nothingness in `SwiftUI`: `EmptyView` for layout, `EmptyModifier` for compilation, and `ContentUnavailableView` for intentional empty states—each serves a different architectural purpose.

### [Visualise anything with SwiftUI Charts](https://khorbushko.github.io/article/2026/01/18/custom-indicator.html)

[Kyryl Horbushko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyryl-horbushko-67936bb5/) builds a custom radial stress indicator using `SectorMark` and reveals the animation pitfalls that caught him by surprise.


## Swift

### [Method Dispatch in Swift: The Complete Guide](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/swift-method-dispatch)

Why does Swift support four different method dispatch mechanisms? [Jacob Bartlett](https://bsky.app/profile/jacobstechtavern.com) breaks down how inlining, static dispatch, table dispatch, and message dispatch affect performance.

### [The Identifiable Protocol in Swift](https://wesleydegroot.nl/blog/identifiable-protocol-in-swift)

Need to make custom types work seamlessly with `SwiftUI` lists and navigation? [Wesley de Groot](https://bsky.app/profile/0xwdg.bsky.social) breaks down when and how to leverage `Identifiable` for everything from simple models to complex `SwiftData` integrations.


## Framework

### [Surviving tvOS: An Engineering Log of an Atypical Media Player](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/surviving-tvos/)

Building for `tvOS` means confronting Focus Engine mysteries, missing `WebView`, and storage constraints that force cache-only strategies. [Ronnie Wong](https://mastodon.social/@ronniew) documents the workarounds that kept Syncnext player alive.

### [A Deep Dive into SwiftData migrations](https://www.donnywals.com/a-deep-dive-into-swiftdata-migrations/)

`SwiftData` schema changes inevitable—but which need manual migrations and which happen automatically? [Donny Wals](https://bsky.app/profile/donnywals.bsky.social) explores the boundaries between automatic reshaping and bridge versions for complex transformations.


## Development

### [Why VIPER and MVVM in SwiftUI are actually the same pattern: A lesson in architectural thinking](https://matteomanferdini.com/mvvm-vs-viper/)

[Matteo Manferdini](https://github.com/matteom) maps VIPER components directly onto MVVM equivalents—Views to Content Views, Interactors to ViewModels, Presenters to Root Views—and explains why VIPER's boilerplate isn't worth it in `SwiftUI`.

### [Modularity as an Architectural Choice](https://livsycode.com/best-practices/modularity-as-an-architectural-choice/)

Modularity promises independence but often delivers circular dependencies and inflated interfaces. [Artem Mirzabekian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-mirzabekian/) warns that splitting code without architectural discipline creates more problems than it solves.
