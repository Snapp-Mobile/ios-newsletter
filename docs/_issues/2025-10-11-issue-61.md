Hi folks,

OpenAI launched their [GPT Store](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-gpt-store/) this week ‚Äî an interesting pivot that has many of us curious (especially those in the EU still waiting for access‚Ä¶ though a VPN might just work, not that I said anything üòè). 

Meanwhile, Apple has quietly rolled out updates to the Developer Program License Agreement. If you have an account, take a moment to review and accept the changes - better safe than sorry when it comes to Apple agreements. üçè 

In this issue, we're diving into Foundation Models streaming, exploring SwiftUI's Liquid Glass design challenges, and discovering how to test private Swift members without breaking encapsulation.
