Hi folks,

Another week, another round of exciting updates from Apple! Following last week's Beta 5 releases, we're now diving into Beta 6 across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. The sleek "Liquid Glass" design aesthetic continues to mature, and we're seeing even more refinements and new capabilities emerge.

This week, we're particularly excited about the new Phone and Journal apps finally making their way to macOS, alongside a cross-platform Games app â€“ a welcome addition for many! On watchOS, the AI-powered Workout Buddy is shaping up nicely, and visionOS users can look forward to even more refined spatial widgets and lifelike Personas.

It's clear that Apple is putting the finishing touches on these releases, and the developer experience is only getting better.

Enjoy the selection of articles we have for you this week.

Happy coding!
