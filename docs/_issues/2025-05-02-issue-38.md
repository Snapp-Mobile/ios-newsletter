Hi folks,

This week we're focusing on error handling by linking two articles (from the same author) on the topic. As usual SwiftUI is at the center of the UI/UX section, with some `Canvas` drawing, `NavigationLink` API enhancements and component styling.

And, we haven't forgotten the (almost obligatory) Mac-related article!

Enjoy!

## Swift

### [Unlocking the Real Power of Swift 6's Typed Throws with Error Chains](https://www.fline.dev/swift-6-typed-throws-error-chains/)

[Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/jeehut) offers a thoughtful exploration of Swift 6’s typed throws feature. This post addresses the challenges of error propagation in layered applications by introducing a custom protocol to simplify error handling while maintaining the context.

### [Swift Error Handling Done Right: Overcoming the Objective-C Error Legacy](https://www.fline.dev/swift-error-handling-done-right-overcoming-the-objective-c-error-legacy/)

In another article [Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/jeehut) looks at another pitfall in Swift development: the challenge to display custom error messages correctly due to how Swift bridges to Objective-C’s `NSError`. He offers a craftier and friendlier approach to error handling by adding a custom protocol.

## UI/UX

### [Styling Components in SwiftUI](https://movingparts.io/styling-components-in-swiftui)

What a piece of art done by [Kasper Lahti](https://github.com/kasper-lahti)! Customization might be painful, but not for this guy. We were lucky to attend his talk at [NSSpain](https://vimeo.com/865570738) in person, as it was one that we can still recall pieces of.

### [Drawing symbols with Canvas](https://www.createwithswift.com/drawing-symbols-with-canvas/)

This article by [Antonella Giugliano](https://bsky.app/profile/elladeveloper.bsky.social) introduces drawing with symbols in SwiftUI’s `Canvas` with clarity and purpose. It makes a complex topic feel approachable. A solid read for anyone exploring custom rendering in SwiftUI.

### [Using `equatable()` to Avoid the NavigationLink Pre-Build Pitfall](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/using-equatable-to-avoid-the-navigationlink-pre-build-pitfall/)

This post not only highlights the issue that `NavigationLink` has (it renders the linked view in advance, which can be a bottleneck in some scenarios), but also resolves it in a clear and concise way.

### [SwiftUI ForEach Explained with Code Examples](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/swiftui-foreach-loop-index/)

[Antoine van der Lee](https://bsky.app/profile/avanderlee.com) offers a clear and practical explanation of how to use `ForEach` with indices in SwiftUI. There are useful code examples for some of the most common use cases.

### [Create a fully custom About window for a Mac app in SwiftUI](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/FullyCustomAboutWindowForAMacAppInSwiftUI/)

[Natalia Panferova](https://github.com/nataliapanferova) provides a comprehensive guide on designing a personalized About window for macOS applications using SwiftUI. It details how to replace the default About panel with a custom `AboutView`, offering full control over layout, content, and appearance.

And to round it all up, we highly recommend checking out this insightful reflection from [Daniel H Steinberg](https://dimsumthinking.com/Info/) on WWDC or WW~~D~~C. It’s definitely worth the read!
