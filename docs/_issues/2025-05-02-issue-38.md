Hi folks,



Enjoy!

## Swift

### [Unlocking the Real Power of Swift 6's Typed Throws with Error Chains](https://www.fline.dev/swift-6-typed-throws-error-chains/)

[Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/jeehut) offers a thoughtful exploration of Swift 6’s typed throws feature. It addresses the challenges of error propagation in layered applications, introducing the Catching protocol as a solution to simplify error handling and maintain context.

### [Swift Error Handling Done Right: Overcoming the Objective-C Error Legacy](https://www.fline.dev/swift-error-handling-done-right-overcoming-the-objective-c-error-legacy/)

Another one from [Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/jeehut) addresses a common issue in Swift development: the failure of custom error messages to display correctly due to Swift’s bridging to Objective-C’s `NSError`. He introduces the `Throwable` protocol from his `ErrorKit` library as a solution, offering a more intuitive and developer-friendly approach to error handling. 

## SwiftUI

### [Styling Components in SwiftUI](https://movingparts.io/styling-components-in-swiftui)

What a piece of art done by [Kasper Lahti](https://github.com/kasper-lahti)! Customization might be painful, but not for this guy. We were lucky to listen to his talk at [NSSpain](https://vimeo.com/865570738) and it was nothing but inspiring. 


### [Drawing symbols with Canvas](https://www.createwithswift.com/drawing-symbols-with-canvas/)

This article by [Antonella Giugliano](https://bsky.app/profile/elladeveloper.bsky.social) introduces drawing with symbols in SwiftUI’s `Canvas` with clarity and purpose. It’s visually supported, and makes a complex topic feel approachable. A solid read for anyone exploring custom rendering in SwiftUI.


### [Using `equatable()` to Avoid the NavigationLink Pre-Build Pitfall](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/using-equatable-to-avoid-the-navigationlink-pre-build-pitfall/)

It nitpicks what could easily be missed during development. This article not only highlights the issue but also resolves it — a dream!

### [SwiftUI ForEach Explained with Code Examples](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/swiftui-foreach-loop-index/)

This article by [Antoine van der Lee](https://bsky.app/profile/avanderlee.com) offers a clear and practical explanation of how to use `ForEach` with indices in SwiftUI. It provides useful code examples that help developers avoid common pitfalls.

## Mac

### [Create a fully custom About window for a Mac app in SwiftUI](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/FullyCustomAboutWindowForAMacAppInSwiftUI/)

[Natalia Panferova](https://github.com/nataliapanferova) provides a comprehensive guide on designing a personalized About window for macOS applications using SwiftUI. It details how to replace the default About panel with a custom `AboutView`, offering full control over layout, content, and appearance.
