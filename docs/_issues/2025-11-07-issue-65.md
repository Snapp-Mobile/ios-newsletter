Hi folks,

Apple's [*Optimize your app's speed and efficiency*](https://www.youtube.com/live/yXAQTIKR8fk) digs into real performance challenges: long view body updates, unnecessary re-renders, and inefficient data flows. If you missed it live, [Ilian Konchev](https://bsky.app/profile/ikonchev.bsky.social) captured comprehensive [Q&A notes](https://gist.github.com/stinger/6d60a95ef20e0c7c7417a32c9e0cf017) worth reviewing.

This week also brought 26.2 betas across all platforms, plus a fresh [App Store web experience](https://apps.apple.com/us/iphone/today) designed to make app discovery easier.

In this issue, we’re exploring SwiftUI gestures and animations, diving into performance optimization and compiler improvements, and uncovering practical patterns for form validation, localization, and platform-specific development.

## Swift

### [Roadmap for improving the type checker](https://forums.swift.org/t/roadmap-for-improving-the-type-checker/82952)

Tired of "compiler unable to type-check this expression" errors? [Slava Pestov](https://mathstodon.xyz/@slava) outlines Swift's roadmap to make complex type checking exponentially faster.

## SwiftUI

### [Quick actions in SwiftUI](https://wesleydegroot.nl/blog/quick-actions-for-swiftui)

Want to add long-press quick actions to your SwiftUI app? [Wesley de Groot](https://wesleydegroot.nl/blog/) breaks down the UIKit integration needed to make it work seamlessly.

### [Zooming With The Magnify Gesture in SwiftUI](https://serialcoder.dev/text-tutorials/swiftui/zooming-with-the-magnify-gesture-in-swiftui/)

Need pinch-to-zoom in your SwiftUI app? [Gabriel Theodoropoulos](https://mastodon.cloud/@gabtheodor) demonstrates handling both temporary and persistent magnification with `MagnifyGesture`.

### [Playing with Sheet (on iOS)](https://captainswiftui.substack.com/p/playing-with-sheet-on-ios)

Need to master iOS sheet presentations beyond basic modals? [Danny Bolella](https://bsky.app/profile/dbolella.bsky.social) explores how `presentationDetents`, interactive gestures, and dismissal patterns let you create fluid, context-aware interfaces in SwiftUI.

### [Power-Up SwiftUI Form Validation with Key Paths](https://danielsaidi.com/blog/2025/10/24/power-up-swiftui-form-validation-with-key-paths)

Form validation boilerplate getting out of control? [Daniel Saidi](https://bsky.app/profile/danielsaidi.bsky.social) shows how keypaths reduce repetition and boost readability in SwiftUI forms.

### [Find the SwiftUI Views that Update the Most Using Instruments](https://swiftdevjournal.com/posts/swiftui-frequent-view-updates/)

Is your SwiftUI app rendering views more than expected? [Mark Szymczyk](https://mastodon.world/@swiftdevjournal) shows how to identify the culprits using Xcode 26's new SwiftUI Instruments.

## Framework

### [static const in header cost: dyld ships with redundant 2KB data copy](https://kyleye.top/posts/dyld-redundant-data-copy/)

Every kilobyte counts in system frameworks — [Kyle Ye](https://mastodon.world/@KyleYe) reveals how `static const` in headers creates redundant binary bloat and how `inline constexpr` fixes it.

## visionOS

### [Deep Dive into Animation on visionOS](https://stepinto.vision/articles/deep-dive-into-animation-on-visionos/)

Overwhelmed by visionOS animation options? [Cristian Díaz](https://bsky.app/profile/elkraneo.bsky.social) demystifies the 10 animation mechanisms available, helping you choose the right tool for motion challenges.
