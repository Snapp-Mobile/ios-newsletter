Hi folks!

`[i|mac|tv|vision|watch]OS` 26.3 is out in the wild, and we’re now waiting for the final Xcode 26.3 release—with its new agentic coding powers. Safari 26.3 also gained support for Zstandard, a fast, lossless compression algorithm designed for real-time scenarios with impressive compression ratios.

Along with the positive news on the releases, there was an update that may have been overlooked. [Apple is reportedly pushing back Gemini-powered Siri features beyond iOS 26.4](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/11/apple-reportedly-pushing-back-gemini-powered-siri-features-beyond-ios-26-4/) -  yet another setback in their effort to deliver truly competitive capabilities to Siri.

### [Debug NSUserActivity in SwiftUI with Hidden Logging Flag](https://kyleye.top/tips/swiftui-useractivity-debug-logging/)

[Kyle Ye](https://mastodon.world/@KyleYe){: .author}

`NSUserActivity` debugging in SwiftUI is a black box—until you enable a hidden logging flag that reveals handler timing and activity updates. Check this article to discover how.

## Tools

### [XcodeBuildMCP](https://github.com/getsentry/XcodeBuildMCP)

Dubbed _"A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and CLI that provides tools for agent use when working on iOS and macOS projects"_ XcodeBuildMCP is a pretty well-documented open-source MCP server that you can now use along with the one that Apple ships with Xcode 26.3. 

Recently, it was promoted to version 2 and now ships with tons of updates (a new CLI, LLDB debugging, MCP tool annotations, Xcode integration and interoperability, config file support for project-level fine-tuning, and more). Definitely worth a look!

That’s it for Issue 79 — see you next week!
