Hi folks,  

The holidays are almost here! Many of us spend this time tinkering with code, but maybe it’s also worth taking a break and enjoying some offline moments? If you need a little nudge, check out [DoNilDisturbPlugin](https://github.com/icanzilb/DoNilDisturbPlugin) by [Marin Todorov](https://mastodon.social/@icanzilb) - it didn't get old.  

Jokes aside, it’s been an amazing year for the iOS community and for our newsletter. The community keeps growing at an exciting pace, and we’re committed to keeping up: sharing articles we love, every week, with passion.  

This week, Apple released [iOS 26.2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_2-release-notes) and [Xcode 26.2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26_2-release-notes), bringing alarm support in Reminders and customizable Lock Screen time opacity. Haven’t updated yet? Now’s the time - [App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/release-notes/) requires submissions built with the new SDK.  

And for the curious, [iOS 26.3 beta 1](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_3-release-notes) dropped on Dec 15, alongside betas for iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. Dive in if you want a sneak peek at what’s next!  

In this issue, we’re exploring Swift Configuration 1.0’s debut, digging into SwiftUI scene management for macOS apps, and discovering how MetricKit opens doors to deep performance monitoring beyond Xcode Organizer.  

Stay sharp, stay curious, and enjoy this week’s picks!
