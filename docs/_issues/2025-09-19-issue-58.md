Hello folks!

This week brings major releases across Apple's ecosystem. We've got `iOS 26`, `macOS Tahoe 26`, `watchOS 26`, `visionOS 26`, and `tvOS 26`, all featuring the new `Liquid Glass` design with persistent widgets, spatial experiences, and FDA-cleared hypertension alerts.

We're also thrilled with how thin the new `iPhone Air` is and how worth buying the new `AirPods` are. Hope you're lucky enough to have gotten your hands on them already!
