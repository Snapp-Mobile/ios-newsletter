Hi folks!

Another week, another agentic model steals our attention. It's supposedly a lucky time to have these tools in hand, right? Well, yes — but [we should be frank](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/11/be-honest-when-claude-code-writes-your-software/) when using them. As developers, the responsibility falls on us to use these tools wisely and honestly, especially when they're writing our code.

This week, we're diving deep into **concurrency patterns**, **framework fundamentals**, **UI polish**, and the occasional reminder that even building a veggie garden teaches us about software design. Plus, we explore what happens when your database connections decide to have a meltdown.

Whether you're wrestling with async/await semantics, fine-tuning SwiftUI layouts, or troubleshooting database pools, there's something for every Swift developer here.

With LLMs handling much of the heavy lifting, is a personal [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) still valuable? [Christian Tietze](https://christiantietze.de) argues it's more essential than ever for building lasting expertise:

> The proof of your expertise and understanding is in how the artifact, the software, behaves in the end.
