Hi folks,

The end of summer is upon us, and you know what that means... new iPhones! Apple has officially announced their "Awe Dropping" event for September 9th. We're expecting to see the new iPhone 17 lineup, updated Apple Watches, and get the official release dates for iOS 26 and all the other new OS versions.

Speaking of which, the beta train keeps on rolling. This week, Apple dropped the eighth developer betas for all major OSes, along with the fifth public betas for iOS and iPadOS 26. We're getting so close to the public release!

Let's dive into this week's standout articles. Enjoy the selection of articles we've put together for you this week.

Happy coding!
