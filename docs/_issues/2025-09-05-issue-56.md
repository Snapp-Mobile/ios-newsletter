Hi folks,

Another exciting week in Apple's ecosystem! Just when we thought we were on the final stretch, Apple surprised us all with Beta 9 for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 "Tahoe". It's packed with refinements to Liquid Glass, Apple Intelligence, and more.

Next week brings us the next iPhone - but just as important is the presentation itself. It always brings us together, sparking both debate and praise. We can’t wait to see what’s unveiled.

Got a great selection of articles for you this week to help you keep up with all the changes.

Enjoy the issue and happy coding!
