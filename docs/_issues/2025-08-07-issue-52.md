Hi folks!

This week has been buzzing with Apple's latest beta drops across all platforms, bringing us even closer to the future of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. We're seeing more of that sleek "Liquid Glass" UI, exciting new features like the AI-driven "Workout Buddy" on watchOS, and spatial home screen widgets on visionOS. Plus, Xcode 26 beta 5 is out with a new Apple Silicon-only build, and App Store Connect is now ready for your beta submissions!

It's an exciting time to be an Apple developer, with so many new tools and features to explore.

Enjoy this week's selection of articles, and happy coding!

## Swift

### [Uncertain\<T>](https://nshipster.com/uncertainty/)

In this article, [Mattt](https://github.com/mattt) introduces a Swift implementation of the `Uncertain<T>` type for probabilistic programming, arguing that traditional boolean logic is inadequate for representing uncertainty in software. The article demonstrates how this generic type allows developers to model probabilistic data (like GPS coordinates) and perform calculations while preserving uncertainty information throughout the computation.

## SwiftUI

### [Implementing advanced speech-to-text in your SwiftUI app](https://www.createwithswift.com/implementing-advanced-speech-to-text-in-your-swiftui-app/)

This tutorial by [Matteo Altobello](https://bsky.app/profile/matteoaltobello.bsky.social) guides you through implementing real-time voice transcription in your SwiftUI app using Apple's new `SpeechAnalyzer` API. Learn the steps from audio capture to text conversion.

## Swift Concurrency

### [Modern Swift Lock: Mutex & the Synchronization Framework](https://www.avanderlee.com/concurrency/modern-swift-lock-mutex-the-synchronization-framework/)

This article by [Antoine van der Lee](https://bsky.app/profile/avanderlee.com) explores `Mutex` as a lightweight alternative to actors for thread-safe operations. Learn how to protect your data and work with non-Sendable types effectively.

### [Sendable, sending, and nonsending](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/sendable-sending-nonsending/)

This article by [Xu Yang](https://bsky.app/profile/fatbobman.com) provides a deep dive into Swift's concurrency model, clarifying the roles of `Sendable`, `sending`, and `nonsending`. Learn how to safely pass data across isolation domains and avoid common pitfalls that can compromise strict concurrency checking.

### [Global actor in Swift Concurrency explained with code examples](https://www.avanderlee.com/concurrency/global-actor/)

Another one from [Antoine van der Lee](https://bsky.app/profile/avanderlee.com) - this article demystifies the `Global actor` concept in Swift Concurrency. Learn how it centralizes and controls concurrent tasks across your app, similar to `@MainActor`, with practical code examples.

### [Swift Observations AsyncSequence for State Changes](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-observations-asyncsequence-for-state-changes/)

This article by [Keith Harrison](https://bsky.app/profile/useyourloaf.com) explores how `Swift 6.2` and `iOS 26`'s new `Observations` type, combined with `AsyncSequence`, provides a reliable solution for persisting your app's scene state in SwiftUI, even in unexpected termination scenarios.

### [@isolated(any)](https://nshipster.com/isolated-any/)

In this article, [Matt Massicotte](https://bsky.app/profile/massicotte.org) demystifies the `@isolated(any)` attribute in Swift concurrency. Discover how this powerful feature enables more intelligent scheduling and unlocks new possibilities for `async` functions.

## Video

### [The most common mistake when using TaskGroup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdOsqtvow0)

In this video, [Vincent Pradeilles](https://bsky.app/profile/v-pradeilles.bsky.social) explains a common error when using `TaskGroup` in Swift. Learn how to avoid this pitfall and ensure your concurrent code functions correctly.
