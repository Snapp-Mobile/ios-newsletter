## Swift

### [Some keyword in Swift: Opaque types explained with code examples](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/some-opaque-types)

The `some` keyword in Swift declares opaque types, and Swift 5.1 introduced it with support for opaque result types. Many engineers experience working with opaque types for the first time when writing a body of a SwiftUI view. Though, it’s often unclear what some keyword does and when to use them in other places. [Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl) discovers.

### [Migrating to Swift 6](https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/migrationguide)

Apple announced Swift 6 during WWDC 2024 as a major release of their programming language. After almost 4 years in development (from the originally announced roadmap) it's finally here and there's a lot things new about it to consider before migrating your apps. This guide by the Swift Language Group outlines the process.

## macOS

### [Spotlight-like hotkey window](https://ardentswift.com/posts/hotkey-window)

[Daniel Arden](https://danielarden.com) with a useful article on how to create a system-wide Spotlight-like hotkey window for our SwiftUI app. In this article he explains how to create a window that would float on top of all other windows and can be triggered on any macOS space by pressing a user-customizable hotkey window, just like Spotlight.

## UI

### [Create Custom SF Symbols in Sketch](https://www.danijelavrzan.com/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols)

Symbols (or icons) are an essential part of any app. It would be impossible to create software without them. Luckily, when developing for Apple platforms, we have the amazing [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) at our disposal. And even although there are thousands of pre-made symbols we can choose from, there might be a time where the one you need just doesn't exist yet. Hop on to discover how to do it.

### [Using TextRenderer to create highlighted text](https://alexanderweiss.dev/blog/2024-06-24-using-textrenderer-to-create-highlighted-text)

`TextRenderer` is a new protocol introduced at WWDC 2024 which lets us enhance how text is rendered in SwiftUI. Here's an article that shows you how to create a view that enables you to highlight certain parts of a given String. Previously this was primarily done using `NSAttributedString`, but with `TextRenderer` it is now possible to do the same in a pure SwiftUI way.

### [SwiftUI Field Guide](https://www.swiftuifieldguide.com)

Here's something for every iOS dev - an interactive guide to help you build an intuition of how the SwiftUI layout system works. Although such guides usually exist in the form of native apps, this is the first web-driven one that we saw.

## XCode

### [How to use EditorConfig files in Xcode](https://www.polpiella.dev/xcode-editor-config)

As a developer for Apple platforms, you probably work on multiple projects with different coding styles and conventions and have to find yourself adjusting Xcode’s editor settings every time you switch between projects. Thankfully Xcode 16 adds support for [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) files, which allows you to define Xcode editor settings in a programmatic way on a per-project basis, here's how.

### [Why Cleaning Xcode Cache is Essential: A Step-by-Step Guide and Recommended Tools](https://medevel.com/clean-xcode-cache)

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) is an incredibly powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, designed for creating apps for all Apple platforms. However, as with any sophisticated tool, Xcode can accumulate a significant amount of cache over time.

This cache, while useful for speeding up the build process, can become massive, leading to a bloated system and potential performance issues. Understanding why and how to clean this cache is essential for maintaining an optimized development environment.
