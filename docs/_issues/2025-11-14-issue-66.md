Hi folks!

This week Apple shipped improvements to Xcode with better coding intelligence and faster performance on large projects - the kind of iterative work that doesn't make headlines but makes your day easier. Check the [Xcode release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26_1-release-notes) for details. The new iOS beta added Liquid Glass effects in Measure, a refreshed Games app, and AI-generated podcast chapters.

Meanwhile, distributed systems tooling is coming to Swift. [Franz Busch](https://bsky.app/profile/franzbusch.bsky.social) announced the open source [Temporal Swift SDK](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-temporal-sdk/) — a framework that handles workflow orchestration so you can focus on business logic rather than failure modes.

The [Swift Student Challenge 2026](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/developers-decode-their-journeys-from-app-ideas-to-app-store/) submissions open in February 2026 (specifically Feb 6-28) - if you mentor junior developers or know someone building their first app, bookmark it now.

In this issue: robust concurrency patterns and notifications, SwiftUI's task identity nuances, AI-powered image generation, testing at scale, health tracking integration, immersive visionOS experiences, and shipping binaries with automation.
