Hi folks!

Holiday time is coming to an end. Recharging the batteries is more important than ever — working days are back, and we need to stay sharp. Before diving into this week’s picks, let’s catch up on what’s new in the Apple ecosystem.

The [Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=76371du6) was updated, adding new privacy rules and recording disclosure requirements. It also includes expanded side-button launch rules for voice apps, Japan-specific distribution terms, and Wi-Fi framework clarifications.

Apple also released [iOS 26.3 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes), improving iPhone-to-Android transfers and — in the EU — adding new options to forward iPhone notifications to third-party devices. The Swift team shipped the latest [What's new in Swift](https://www.swift.org/blog/whats-new-in-swift-december-2025/) — worth a look.

In this issue, we're exploring subprocess management in Swift, dependency injection patterns, AI-powered development workflows, and SwiftUI's adaptive presentation APIs. Stay sharp, stay curious, and enjoy this week's picks!

## SwiftUI

### [Adaptive sheet presentation in SwiftUI](https://alexanderweiss.dev/blog/2025-12-30-adaptive-sheet-presentation-in-swiftui)

Need different sheet behavior on iPad vs iPhone? [Alexander Weiß](https://mastodon.online/@alexanderwe) demonstrates specifics for size-aware presentation.


## Swift

### [Introduction to the Swift Subprocess Package](https://swiftdevjournal.com/posts/subprocess/)

Need to spawn processes in Swift apps? [Mark Szymczyk](https://mastodon.world/@meandmark) reveals how the Swift `Subprocess` package simplifies running Terminal commands and launching command-line programs.

### [Understanding date decoding strategies when working with JSON in Swift](https://tanaschita.com/swift-json-date-decoding-encoding)

APIs send dates in different formats—which `JSONDecoder` strategy should you use? [Natascha Fadeeva](https://mastodon.social/@tanaschita) explains when to use timestamps, ISO 8601, or custom formatters.

### [Versioned Package.swift Files](https://massicotte.org/blog/package-swift/)

Using versioned `Package.swift` files exclusively for tools versions? [Matt Massicotte](https://bsky.app/profile/massicotte.org) argues that this common pattern has zero benefit.


## Development

### [Explicit Dependency Injection](https://livsycode.com/best-practices/explicit-dependency-injection/)

Does your app really need a DI framework? [Artem Mirzabekian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-mirzabekian/) shows how simple, intentional dependency injection scales without magic.

### [The Age of the Micro-Entrepreneur](https://merowing.info/posts/the-age-of-micro-entrepreneurs/)

One developer can now build what teams built before. [Krzysztof Zabłocki](https://bsky.app/profile/merowing.bsky.social) explores how AI is democratizing app creation.


## Tools

### [Closing the Loop on iOS with Claude Code](https://twocentstudios.com/2025/12/27/closing-the-loop-on-ios-with-claude-code/)

What if Claude could build, test, and debug your iOS app autonomously? [Chris Trott](https://bsky.app/profile/twocentstudios.com) highlights closing the loop with simulator automation.

### [Replay](https://nshipster.com/replay/)

Tired of mocking HTTP responses in tests? Check this great article from [Mattt](https://github.com/mattt) on how to record real API traffic once and replay it forever.
