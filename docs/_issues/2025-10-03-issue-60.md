Hello folks!

Welcome to Issue 60! This week brings exciting news: [Apple's official launch of the Foundation Models framework](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apples-foundation-models-framework-unlocks-new-intelligent-app-experiences/), enabling privacy-preserving on-device intelligence in iOS 26 and beyond. We're diving deep into Swift 6 concurrency patterns, exploring iPadOS 26's new Window Controls, mastering SPM Traits, and tackling visionOS spatial interactions. Plus, practical guides on CI/CD tooling, SwiftUI file handling, and debugging complex TCA architectures.

## Swift

### [Swift Default Value in String Interpolations](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-default-value-in-string-interpolations/)

[Keith Harrison](https://bsky.app/profile/useyourloaf.com) explains how Swift 6.2 introduces a new default value parameter for string interpolation, allowing developers to provide a default string for optional values regardless of their type.

### [Using MainActor.assumeIsolated to Solve Legacy API Compatibility Issues with Swift 6](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/mainactor-assumeisolated/)

[Xu Yang](https://bsky.app/profile/fatbobman.com) addresses integrating legacy Apple APIs with Swift 6's strict concurrency checking, demonstrating how `MainActor.assumeIsolated` provides a `MainActor` context within synchronous methods through examples with `NSTextAttachmentViewProvider` and `UIHostingController`.
### [All about Swift Package Manager Traits](https://theswiftdev.com/2025/all-about-swift-package-manager-traits/)

[Tibor BÃ¶decs](https://mastodon.social/@tiborbodecs) explores how `Trait` objects act as feature flags, enabling conditional compilation, optional dependencies, and advanced package configurations in SPM.

## SwiftUI

### [The File Importer in SwiftUI](https://serialcoder.dev/text-tutorials/swiftui/the-file-importer-in-swiftui/)

Learn to implement SwiftUI's `fileImporter` modifier for importing documents into your app. [Gabriel Theodoropoulos](https://mastodon.cloud/@gabtheodor) covers security-scoped resources, handling multiple file types with `UTType`, and properly managing access permissions for files outside your app's sandbox.

### [Adopting the New Window Controls in iPadOS 26](https://open.substack.com/pub/juniperphoton/p/adopting-the-new-window-controls?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

[Weichao Deng](https://github.com/JuniperPhoton) details how to adopt iPadOS 26's new Window Controls and macOS-like menu bar when Apple's documentation lacks specifics on `UIView.layoutRegion.margins(cornerAdaptation:)`.

## visionOS

### [Deep Dive into Manipulation on visionOS](https://stepinto.vision/articles/deep-dive-into-manipulation-on-visionos/)

[Joseph Simpson](https://bsky.app/profile/vrhermit.com) breaks down how `ManipulationComponent` standardizes complex interactions on Apple Vision Pro, making 3D content interactive through pinch gestures, rotation, and scaling.

## Development

### [How to install Xcode 26's Metal Toolchain on CI/CD](https://www.polpiella.dev/metal-toolchain-ci-cd)

Xcode 26 no longer bundles the Metal toolchain by default, causing build failures on CI/CD runners. [Pol Piella Abadia](https://bsky.app/profile/polpielladev.bsky.social) demonstrates how to use `xcodebuild -downloadComponent` and `-importComponent` commands to automate toolchain installation in your CI workflows.

### [The TCA Playbook: Debugging Large Reducers Without Losing Your Mind](https://www.wesleymatlock.com/the-tca-playbook-debugging-large-reducers-without-losing-your-mind/)

[Wesley Matlock](https://github.com/wesmatlock) shares practical debugging techniques for complex `Reducer` architectures in TCA, including state inspection tools and mental models for managing large application state.
