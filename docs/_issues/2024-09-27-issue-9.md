## Swift

### [Power of Swift Macros](https://arturgruchala.com/power-of-swift-macros/)

Working on `UIKit`-only projects does not mean you should miss on some of the timesavers Xcode has to offer. And yes - we mean previews first and foremost. As useful as they are, previews are mostly tailored for `SwiftUI` so in order to use it with `UIKit` views you have to write some boilerplate - mainly wrapping your `UIView` in `UIViewRepresentable`. Here's how to avoid writing all that boilerplate with the help of Swift Macros.

### [How to keep Date’s microseconds precision in Swift](https://augmentedcode.io/2024/09/23/how-to-keep-dates-microseconds-precision-in-swift/)

Dealing different `String` representations of a `Date` can be quite challenging in some cases. It does not help that the default iOS `DateFormatter` is not tailored for supporting precision at microsecond granularity but, as usual, there are ways to fill in the gap as [Toomas Vahter](https://augmentedcode.io/author/toomasvahter/) discovered.

## UI

### [Animating number changes in SwiftUI](https://sarunw.com/posts/animating-number-changes-in-swiftui/)

We love these on-point articles from [Sarun W](https://x.com/sarunw). Sometimes what a view composition needs is a neat animation to highlight a value change. Apple is using a nice numbers animation across their widgeting system and this article shows you how to apply that very same animation on any `SwiftUI` text view that contains numbers.

### [How to Use SwiftData in UIKit Apps](https://www.appcoda.com/swiftdata-uikit/)

As `SwiftUI` gets more of the hype `UIKit` is still around and still faces updates with each iOS version. Most of the new libraries are being demoed using `SwiftUI` though, while that's not the only option. This article looks at how to integrate the `SwiftData` framework, new from iOS 17, with `UIKit`. Enjoy!

### [Mastering MapKit in SwiftUI. Interactions.](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2023/12/19/mastering-mapkit-in-swiftui-interactions/)

To highlight the statement above - here's an example of interacting with `MapKit` from `SwiftUI`. This article looks at some useful additions to track the map camera changes and to animate them using keyframes. It's always the micro-interactions that make a good app.

### [Integrating Haptic Feedback In SwiftUI Projects](https://serialcoder.dev/text-tutorials/swiftui/integrating-haptic-feedback-in-swiftui-projects/)

This is more of a UX topic, but adding feedback to your apps can vastly improve the user interaction in many places across your apps. Haptics can be used to complement an action feedback like "rewarding" the user on success or complementing an failure message. There are cases here a haptic along with a nice animation may be all that's needed to make a difference and here's how to get started.

### [Insetting Scrollable Views’ Content With contentMargins In SwiftUI](https://serialcoder.dev/text-tutorials/swiftui/insetting-scrollable-views-content-with-contentmargins-in-swiftui/)

With iOS 18 now public some app developers may consider dropping support for iOS 16. This opens the door to adopting some neat `SwiftUI` improvements and additions, introduced with iOS 17. One such addition is the `contentMargins` view modifier that allows you to fine tune the insets of a `ScrollView` content.

## SwiftData

### [SwiftData Deleting Data](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-deleting-data/)

This article looks at a few ways to delete data from `SwiftData`. As the framework is relatively new (from iOS 17) it's helpful to gather knowledge around the differences and the improvements it adds over `CoreData`.
