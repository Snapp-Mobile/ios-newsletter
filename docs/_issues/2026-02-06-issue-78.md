Hi folks!

It's not very often that Apple posts developer-related news on their website, but the release candidate of Xcode 26.3 got a proper PR because of it's [agentic coding capabilities](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/). Some developers are posting details about the new first-tier MCP capabilities baked into the release, the most interesting among which is the ability to run SwiftUI previews.

The week was also big for Swift with a [Windows working group announcement on Swift website](https://www.swift.org/blog/announcing-windows-workgroup/). It outlines the goals of the working group:

> The primary goal is to ensure ongoing support for Swift on Windows, enabling users to develop Windows applications using the Swift programming language and its associated tools.

In the last bit of news, we're getting really close to the final release of iOS 26.3 with the release candidate already in testing, while the latest macOS betas are hinting that [M5-powered MacBook Pro is coming soon](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/04/latest-macos-26-3-beta-adds-to-signs-that-new-m5-macbook-pros-are-imminent/)
