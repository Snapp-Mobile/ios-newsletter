### [An update about Swift Testing in the Swift 6 toolchain](https://forums.swift.org/t/an-update-about-swift-testing-in-the-swift-6-toolchain/74075)

`SwiftTesting` is becoming part of the Swift 6 toolchain! The announcement from the Swift core team also states that they’ll be creating the `release/6.0` branch very shortly, in line with the other components of the Swift 6 release. Because Swift Testing will be in the Swift 6 toolchain soon, it won't be necessary for package authors to include it as a package dependency anymore.

### [Introducing Oblivious HTTP support in Swift](https://www.swift.org/blog/introducing-swift-nio-oblivious-http)

[Oblivious HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458.html) is a protocol to allow a client to make requests of a server without the server being able to identify the source of those requests. Conventional HTTP requests can reveal identifying information about the client such as the originating IP address, and can allow multiple requests from the same client to be identified as originating from the same node. An initial support for Oblivious HTTP in Swift NIO is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-oblivious-http)

## SwiftData

### [SwiftData Background Tasks](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-background-tasks)

When using `CoreData` you perform UI operations using a view context on the main queue. To avoid blocking the main queue you perform long running tasks like parsing and importing data using a private background queue context. So, how do you perform a `SwiftData` operation in the background?

### [Mastering SwiftUI Animations: Phase Animations](https://www.mazenkourouche.com/blog/mastering-swiftui-animations-phase-animations)

With SwiftUI's recent advances, animation has become incredibly accessible for iOS developers. One of the latest additions is the phase-based animation, which is designed to animate discrete steps within an animation. This article aims to explore phase-based animations, illustrating the process with custom examples.

### [Creating Advanced Animations with KeyframeAnimator in SwiftUI](https://www.appcoda.com/keyframeanimator/)

In addition to the `PhaseAnimator`, SwiftUI introduced the `KeyframeAnimator` in iOS 17, allowing developers to create advanced animations using keyframes. In this tutorial, we will delve into the `KeyframeAnimator` and learn how to create a more intricate animation.

### [MainActor usage in Swift explained to dispatch to the main thread](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/mainactor-dispatch-main-thread)

MainActor is an attribute introduced in Swift 5.5 as a global actor providing an executor which performs its tasks on the main thread. When building apps, it’s essential to perform UI updating tasks on the main thread, which can sometimes be challenging when using several background threads. Using the `@MainActor` attribute will help ensure your UI is always updated on the main thread.

### [SwiftUI basic Shape operations](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-basic-shape-operations/)

Most complex custom views can be made by composing many basic shapes together. In this article we will look at the basic operations that we can do with them. It may seem trivial, but knowing these basics will benefit you greatly. It's also always great to discover something new while going through a refresher.

### [Cross-Platform Swift: View Paradigms](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep290-cross-platform-swift-view-paradigms)

We are huge fans of what the guys at Point-Free are doing for the Swift Community. Recently they have started pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Swift by looking outside of the Apple ecosystem. There's now a free episode on their website where they do some explorations around the topic of cross-platform.
