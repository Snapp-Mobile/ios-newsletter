## Swift

### [Mastering Observation framework in Swift](http://swiftwithmajid.com/2023/10/03/mastering-observable-framework-in-swift)

Apple introduced the new Observation framework powered by the macro feature of the Swift language. The new Observation framework, in combination with the Swift Concurrency features, allows us to replace the Combine framework that looks deprecated by Apple. This week, we will learn how to use the Observation framework to handle data flow in our apps.

### [Migrating from the Observable Object protocol to the Observable macro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro)

Here's Apple with a dedicated documentation page and a sample app to help us transition from using `ObservableObject` towards adopting the `@Observable` macro.

## SwiftData

### [SwiftData Background Tasks](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-background-tasks)

When using `CoreData` you perform UI operations using a view context on the main queue. To avoid blocking the main queue you perform long running tasks like parsing and importing data using a private background queue context. So, how do you perform a `SwiftData` operation in the background?

## UI

### [Mastering SwiftUI Animations: Phase Animations](https://www.mazenkourouche.com/blog/mastering-swiftui-animations-phase-animations)

With SwiftUI's recent advances, animation has become incredibly accessible for iOS developers. One of the latest additions is the phase-based animation, which is designed to animate discrete steps within an animation. This article aims to explore phase-based animations, illustrating the process with custom examples.

### [Creating Advanced Animations with KeyframeAnimator in SwiftUI](https://www.appcoda.com/keyframeanimator/)

In addition to the `PhaseAnimator`, SwiftUI introduced the `KeyframeAnimator` in iOS 17, allowing developers to create advanced animations using keyframes. In this tutorial, we will delve into the `KeyframeAnimator` and learn how to create a more intricate animation.

### [MainActor usage in Swift explained to dispatch to the main thread](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/mainactor-dispatch-main-thread)

MainActor is a new attribute introduced in Swift 5.5 as a global actor providing an executor which performs its tasks on the main thread. When building apps, itâ€™s essential to perform UI updating tasks on the main thread, which can sometimes be challenging when using several background threads. Using the @MainActor attribute will help ensure your UI is always updated on the main thread.

### [SwiftUI basic Shape operations](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-basic-shape-operations/)

Most complex custom views can be made by composing many basic shapes together. Today we will learn basic operations that we can do with them. It may seem trivial, but knowing these basics will benefit you greatly. It's also always great to discover something new while going through a refresher.

## Utils

### [swift-perception](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-perception)

The Perception library provides tools that mimic `@Observable` and `withObservationTracking` in Swift 5.9, but they are backported to work all the way back to iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13 and watchOS 6. This means you can start taking advantage of Swift 5.9's observation tools today, even if you can't drop support for older Apple platforms.
