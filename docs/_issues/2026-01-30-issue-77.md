Hi folks!

New week, new workgroup - this time it's the [Windows Workgroup](https://www.swift.org/blog/announcing-windows-workgroup/). We can see the trend continuing, and it seems positive. Swift's reach keeps expanding beyond Apple platforms, making cross-platform development more accessible.

Apple released [iOS 26.3 Beta 3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_3-release-notes) along with matching betas for iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS. This beta brings Transfer to Android APIs and a Notification Forwarding framework for third-party smartwatches in the EU. There's also a new **Limit Precise Location** API that lets apps reduce location data granularity shared with cellular carriers on select devices.

Don't forget - the **age rating questionnaire deadline is January 31**, so make sure you complete those updated App Store Connect questions to avoid submission issues. Looking ahead, mark your calendars for the [SwiftUI activity on February 10](https://developer.apple.com/hello/january26/) in Cupertino and Xcode 26 coding intelligence documentation on February 5.
