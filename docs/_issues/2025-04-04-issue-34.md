Hi folks,

This is definitely Swift language week. Swift 6.1 was released — it’s a minor update, but still worth checking out to see what’s now possible. Try it out with Xcode 16.3.

On a personal note, my week was packed with collaboration meetings and client discussions at the architectural level. That’s just part of starting a new project. Though, let’s be honest — sometimes, you’d rather skip the planning and dive straight into coding.

Anyway, this week's articles cover a mix of language updates, architectural patterns, and practical techniques that should help you be more productive. Whether you're exploring the new Swift 6.1 features, implementing better architecture with MVVM, or optimizing data management with SwiftData, there's something here to make your development life easier.

Happy coding!

## Swift Language

### [Swift 6.1 Released](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-6.1-released/)
Exciting news for Swift developers! The latest iteration of our favorite programming language has arrived with Swift 6.1. This release packs a punch with performance optimizations that will make your code run more smoothly and efficiently.

## SwiftUI

### [SwiftUI MVVM](https://matteomanferdini.com/swiftui-mvvm/)
Struggling with organizing your SwiftUI code? [Matteo Manferdini](https://x.com/matmanferdini)'s expert guide to MVVM architecture might be just what you need. I've found his approach to separating concerns particularly enlightening - he breaks down complex concepts into digestible pieces that make sense even if you're new to architectural patterns. A game-changer for anyone looking to level up their SwiftUI skills!

### [Text Concatenation vs Text Interpolation in SwiftUI](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/TextConcatenationVsTextInterpolationInSwiftUI/)
Have you ever wondered which approach is faster when working with text in SwiftUI? This eye-opening analysis by [Natalia Panferova](https://x.com/natpanferova) settles the debate once and for all. This article explores when to use each method for optimal performance.

### [Fast & Fluid: Integrating Rust egui into SwiftUI](https://medium.com/@djalex566/fast-fluid-integrating-rust-egui-into-swiftui-30a218c502c1)
Ready to push the boundaries of SwiftUI performance? This innovative tutorial shows you how to harness the raw power of Rust's egui library within your SwiftUI applications. If you’re experimenting with cross-language integration in your own projects, this guide will provide the clarity you need to make it work seamlessly.

## Data Management

### [Modern URL construction in Swift](https://swiftbysundell.com/articles/modern-url-construction-in-swift/)
John Sundell is back and brings his signature clarity to the sometimes confusing world of URL handling in Swift. What I love about this guide is how it transforms potentially error-prone URL construction into rock-solid, reliable code.

### [Practical SwiftData: Building SwiftUI Applications with Modern Approaches](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/practical-swiftdata-building-swiftui-applications-with-modern-approaches/)
Fat Bob Man delivers a masterclass on Apple's newest data persistence framework. This guide covers everything from the bare essentials to advanced techniques. I’ve used it personally and couldn’t be more grateful.

## Best Practices

### [Documenting Your Code with DocC](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2025/04/01/documenting-your-code-with-docc/)
Writing good documentation can be challenging, but this guide makes the process easier to follow. The tutorial covers the basics of creating structured, interactive documentation, with helpful sections on documentation catalogs and custom Markdown.

## Concurrency

### [Implementing Task Timeout with Swift Concurrency](https://www.donnywals.com/implementing-task-timeout-with-swift-concurrency/)
Discover how to handle timeout scenarios in your Swift applications with this practical guide by Donny Wals. The article walks you through implementing robust timeout functionality for asynchronous tasks using Swift's modern concurrency system.

## App of the week

### [Strata](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6742242942)
A handy little app for making Apple-style icons for your SDK. When we were making one for SnappTheming, let’s just say we aged a bit in the process. This tool? Lifesaver.
