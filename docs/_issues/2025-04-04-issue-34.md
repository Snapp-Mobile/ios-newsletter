Hi folks,

This is definitely Swift language week. Swift 6.1 was released — it’s a minor update, but still worth checking out to see what’s now possible. Try it out with Xcode 16.3.

This week's articles cover a mix of language updates, architectural patterns, and practical techniques that should help you be more productive. Whether you're exploring the new Swift 6.1 features, implementing better architecture with MVVM, or optimizing data management with SwiftData, there's something here to make your development life easier.

Happy coding!

## Swift

### [Swift 6.1 Released](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-6.1-released/)
Exciting news for Swift developers! The latest iteration of our favorite programming language has arrived with Swift 6.1. This release packs a punch with performance optimizations that will make your code run more smoothly and efficiently.
