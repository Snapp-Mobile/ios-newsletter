Hi folks,

This week brings insights into optimizing `SwiftUI` performance, exploring the evolving glass effect design language, and adapting to iPadOS's expanding windowing capabilities. We'll also look at how LLMs are finding their place in production development workflows.

Whether you're fine-tuning scroll performance or implementing the latest design patterns, this issue covers the practical techniques you need to keep your apps running smoothly.

## UI/UX

### [Confirmation and Result Interactive Snippets](https://swiftjectivec.com/App-Intents-Interactive-Snippets-Confirm-vs-Result/)

App Intents can provide richer user interactions through interactive snippets beyond simple command execution. [Jordan Morgan](https://bsky.app/profile/jordanmorgan10.bsky.social) explains implementing `Result` and `Confirmation` snippet types for creating multi-step workflows. As the article notes, these snippets enable "more complex, multi-step interactions" that provide users with meaningful feedback and decision points throughout the intent execution process.

### [Grouping elements within a Glass Effect Container in SwiftUI](https://www.createwithswift.com/grouping-elements-within-a-glass-effect-container-in-swiftui/)

[Antonella Giugliano](https://bsky.app/profile/elladeveloper.bsky.social) demonstrates how to organize SwiftUI elements using a `GlassEffectContainer`. The article covers spacing optimization and glass effect application, showing techniques for both individual components and complete interface sections. A practical guide for developers implementing modern visual design patterns.

### [How to Detect Text Truncation in SwiftUI?](https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/how-to-detect-text-truncation-in-swiftui/)

Text truncation detection can be challenging in SwiftUI due to the framework's layout system. [Xu Yang (Fatbobman)](https://bsky.app/profile/fatbobman.com) presents a solution using `fixedSize` and `GeometryReader` to determine when text content exceeds available space. The approach provides reliable detection for maintaining consistent UI presentation across different content lengths.

### [Glassifying custom SwiftUI views](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2025/07/16/glassifying-custom-swiftui-views/)

[Majid Jabrayilov](https://bsky.app/profile/mecid.bsky.social) explores implementing glass effects in custom SwiftUI views using the `glassEffect` view modifier. The article focuses on integrating this design language into existing custom components, providing developers with techniques to adopt contemporary visual styles while maintaining component functionality.

### [Understanding and Improving SwiftUI Performance](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/understanding-and-improving-swiftui-performance-37b77ac61896)

[Cal Stephens](https://github.com/calda) from Airbnb Engineering examines SwiftUI's performance characteristics, particularly the view diffing algorithm. The article provides actionable optimization strategies for common performance bottlenecks, offering developers concrete techniques to improve app responsiveness and reduce computational overhead.

## iOS

### [SwiftUI Scroll Performance: The 120FPS Challenge](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/swiftui-scroll-performance-the-120fps)

Achieving smooth 120FPS scrolling requires careful consideration of view hierarchy and data handling. [Jacob Bartlett](https://bsky.app/profile/jacobstechtavern.com) compares performance characteristics of `VStack`, `LazyVStack`, and `List` in high-frequency scrolling scenarios. The analysis includes practical benchmarks and optimization techniques for maintaining fluid user interactions.

## iPadOS

### [Windowing on iPadOS (Or How I Learned to Love The Backlog Bomb)](https://captainswiftui.substack.com/p/windowing-on-ipados-or-how-i-learned)

iPadOS continues evolving toward more sophisticated windowing capabilities, requiring developers to reconsider traditional full-screen app assumptions. [Danny Bolella](https://bsky.app/profile/dbolella.bsky.social) examines the implications of these changes for iPad app development, discussing adaptive interface design and multi-window state management considerations.

## Tips

### [LLMs for real code](https://chris.eidhof.nl/post/llms-real-code/)

[Chris Eidhof](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl) shares practical insights on integrating LLMs into development workflows. The article discusses using AI assistance for language exploration, SwiftUI development, and code refinement, providing a balanced perspective on AI tools in production environments rather than theoretical applications.
